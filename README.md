Implementation of NOAAs DRAP model.

### Introduction

DRAP stands for D Region Absortion Prediction. It is an empirical model developped by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 8NOAA) to predict the global radio affectation of HF radiocommunications caused by solar flares. These solar X rays emissions cause a Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance (SID) which absorbs radio waves in the HF range.

This model was developped over the years by making radio measurements of radio absorbtions during the ocurrence of solar flares over the HF range. These radio probes were done in northern latitudes so a more extensive measurements in different latitudes are necessary.  With this measurements an empirical formula was fitted
